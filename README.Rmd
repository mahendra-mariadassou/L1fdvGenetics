# L1fdvGenetics

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `L1fdvGenetics` is to provide interactive tutorials for the Genetics project. Tutorials are packaged so you can install them on you computer and do the exercices without access to an internet connection. 

## Installation

### Local installation

You only need to perform each of the following steps **once**:

- installing **R** 
- installing **Rstudio**
- installing **R** packages `remotes` and `learnr`

However each of them may take some time. 

#### Installing R

Go to the CRAN [webpage](https://cran.r-project.org/), select your OS and follow the instructions. 

- On Windows, you should just download and execute an .exe file. 
- On MacOS, you should just download and execute a .pkg file. 
- On Linux, you can get install R from the command line using something like

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
## If you're on Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install r-base
```

On **Windows**: you may need **Rtools** (unlikely) and **git** 

- **Rtools**: visit the dedicated [page](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/), download the suggested exe and install it on your computer
- **git**: visit the dedicated [page](https://git-scm.com/download/win), download the suggested exe and install it on your computer


On **MacOS**: you may need **XCode** (unlikely)

- **XCode**: visit the dedicated [page](https://mac.r-project.org/tools/), download the **Mandatory tools** and install them on your computer

#### Installing RStudio Desktop

Go to the [download](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) page. Select, download and install the file corresponding to your OS. 

#### Installing R packages

Launch Rstudio (by clicking on the corresponding icon) and execute the following commands in the console
```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("remotes") 
install.packages("learnr") 
```

#### Installation (II)

You need to install the tutorials **every time** I update them (hopefully not too often). 

### Installing the tutorials

You can install the tutorials from [GitHub](https://github.com/) by launching Rstudio and typing the following command in the console:

```r
remotes::install_github("mahendra-mariadassou/L1fdvGenetics")
```

The tutorials included in `L1fdvGenetics` are lightweight and have no dependencies. It should be quite fast and not consume a lot of data. 

### Remote installation: Rstudio Cloud

If you have trouble installing R on your computer, you can also use it on a remote server. **This is not the preferred solution as it's limited to 9 people**. Favor the local installation if you can. 

- Sign up on [Rstudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/)
- Join the [Genetics project](https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/71850/join?access_code=Ojh4cBY8MsdNd44weVIZ6u5txVALu8l8wLriT99k)
- Choose 'Join Space'
- Choose 'Projects' and select 'Start' (blue buttons)
![](inst/images/login_screen.png)
- Rstudio deploys the project on a remote server, **you don't need to install anything else**
- You can then start the tutorial as shown below

### Remote installation: binder

Alternatively, you can use create a remote R session to complete the tutorial by launching binder:  [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mahendra-mariadassou/L1fdvGenetics/master?urlpath=rstudio)

You only need a web browser, no account or anything. The main drawback of this solution (compared to the previous ones) is that you lose your progress each time you launch a new session. 

## Starting a tutorial

This package is intended for use with `learnr` (which should be installed when you install `L1fdvGenetics`). 

There are two tutorials in the package. Make sure to restart R before running a tutorial. **Don't run a tutorial twice (or two different tutorials) in the same R session.**

### Candidate gene (single marker) approach

```{r simple_marker, eval = FALSE}
## Launch only one tutorial at the time and restart R before doing so!!
learnr::run_tutorial("01_candidate_gene", package = "L1fdvGenetics")
```

If you have an error, you can try the following command:
```{r, eval =FALSE}
rmarkdown::run(file = NULL, 
               dir = learnr:::get_tutorial_path("01_candidate_gene",  
                                                package = "L1fdvGenetics"), 
               shiny_args = list(launch.browser = 1))
```

### QTL detection by Simple Interval Mapping (SIM)

```{r sim, eval = FALSE}
## Launch only one tutorial at the time and restart R before doing so!!
learnr::run_tutorial("02_interval_mapping", package = "L1fdvGenetics")
```

If you have an error, you can try the following command:

```{r eval = FALSE}
rmarkdown::run(file = NULL, 
               dir = learnr:::get_tutorial_path("02_interval_mapping",  
                                                package = "L1fdvGenetics"), 
               shiny_args = list(launch.browser = 1))
```



## Assignement 

You can open the (empty) assignment template with:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
file.edit(system.file("assignment/assignment.Rmd", package = "L1fdvGenetics"))
```

Or [download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mahendra-mariadassou/L1fdvGenetics/master/inst/assignment/assignment.Rmd) it from the web. 

**Make a copy and save it on your computer** (you can edit the file you just opened but you can't save it). 

This is an Rmd (similar to a jupyter notebook). You can write R code in **code chuncks** (you shoudn't have to, unless you attempt to detect QTL in Chromosome 2). 

![](inst/images/chunk-parts.png)

You should **knit** the document to an html file once to get the raw results. You can do so by clicking on the knit button. 

![](inst/images/knit_button.png)

You can also execute each chunck in the console using the small green triangle (note that you should execute chuncks in turn as a chunck may depend on previous chuncks). 

![](inst/images/run_code.png)

When you're done adding comments and editing the document (for example, hiding some output from the final reports), you should knit it to a html file and submit it to moodle or through a google form (further instructions will follow).
